	this is my home page <br>
	testing this <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	I cannot add more than the page size worth of text <br>
	I cannot get the side bar to go all the way to the bottom <br>
	the footer ignores the sidebar formatting completely but does not ignore the header <br>
	should I be using fixed positions?
	<br> how do I get multiple columns in the header
